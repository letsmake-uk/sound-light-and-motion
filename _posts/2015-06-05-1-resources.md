## <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino Development Environment</a>

This is where you get the Arduino IDE or "Integrated Development Environment". This is one of the quickest and easiest ways to start programming your Galileo. To get the Arduino IDE talking to your Galileo, follow the steps in this <a href = "http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/IntelGalileoGen2">getting started guide</a>. The Arduino website has tons of great <a href = "http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage">code examples available</a> to get you started. 


## <a href = "http://makezine.com/books/getting-started-with-intel-galileo/"> Make: Getting Started With Intel Galileo</a>

This book is available to order on Amazon, but you can get a free pdf version of it by putting your details in at the link above. It is a lot less technical and more accessible than a lot of other resources out there, and does not assume that you know anything about Arduinos or programming in general.

## <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/galileo-getting-started-guide">Sparkfun Getting Started Guide</a>

This is a great resource for getting your head round exactly what the Galileo is, and how to get up and running with it. One part of this guide that you should **ignore** however, is the "software download/setup" section which tells you to download a separate "Arduino for Galileo" development environment. Just use the standard Arduino IDE linked above. If you are familiar with Linux, this guide will show you how to send terminal commands to the Galileo.


## Make Magazine Getting Started Sessions

These videos feature some of the first members of the Galileo maker community, including one of the creators of <a href = "https://github.com/IntelOpenDesign/ConnectAnyThing">Connect Anything</a>, talking about what exactly the Galileo is, which features they use the most, and showcasing projects that they have made with it.
